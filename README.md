When it's all set and done, you can now access the main page - here, you can see everything our application
has to offer you. ü•∞

We have a very potent search engine to help you find whatever you need, an option to see our registered
bike mechanicals, the bike stores nearby you, the status of you bike's warranty and, finally, the map.

Finally, you can look around you and find the parking lot that better suits your current needs. You will have
access to all the informations about it - how many empty spaces, if it has mechanical support and all sorts
of extra infos.

When you select the option you like the most, you can inform us if your bike needs to be fixed - then, one of
our mechanic partners will be called to your aid. üë∑

And now, let's take a look at our social network:

It's quite simples, in fact. Here, you can connect to your fellow bikers - set up encounters, bike together,
see who's able to meet you somewhere... it's really perfect to find people who are as passionate as you!

And at last, but not least important, you can view your profile info. It's really very intuitive, actually,
and you can see the status of your signature and some cool stuff like that!

## About us

BiCare was created as our project during the FFHacka Hackaton hosted by FairFax. It was developed in the breaf
interval of only two days - so, of course it's not the final version yet. Yet, it's already very useful in your
daily life!
